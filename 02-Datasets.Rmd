# The Datasets {#datasets}

To illustrate the capabilities of the different packages, discuss the potential pitfalls and provide some recommendations, we will use raw geolocator data from three individuals of different species.
The data is publised on Movebank \@ref{movebank} and can be downloaded directly using the R package _move_ (to be done and to be tested!).
